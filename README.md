## Local Development

Because this app is made of two npm projects, there are two places to run `npm` commands:

1. **Node API server** at the root `./`
2. **React UI** in the `frontend/` directory.

### Run the API server

In a terminal:

```bash
# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

### Run the frontend

In a separate terminal from the API server, start the UI:

```bash
# First, switch to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Initial setup
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```
